# MMOMENT Tokenomics: Gamified Network Growth

## Core Problem

How do we create a tokenomics model that:
1. Allows consumers to pay in stable USD-equivalent pricing
2. Enables speculators to get massive exposure easily
3. Gives camera operators upside on their hardware investment
4. Maintains flexibility to iterate and change economics as the network evolves

## Solution: Camera NFTs + Stablecoin Payments

### Two-Asset Model

**1. Stablecoin for Payments (USDC or $MOMENT Stablecoin)**
- All camera access paid in stablecoin (1:1 USD peg)
- Eliminates price volatility for consumers
- Can add "special properties" via smart contract logic (loyalty points, tier benefits, priority access)
- Fully on-chain, no fiat rails required

**2. Camera NFTs as Speculative Assets**
- Limited supply collections (Genesis: 10,000 units, then subsequent launches)
- Each NFT = License to operate one physical camera (Jetson) on the network
- NFT holder earns revenue share from their camera's usage (paid in stablecoin)
- Secondary market provides liquidity and price discovery
- **This is where speculation happens** - investors buy/sell NFTs based on network growth

### Key Innovation: Earned Rarity (Not Purchased)

**Undeployed State:**
- NFTs mint without rarity tier
- All start equal at launch
- Trade at base floor price

**Deployment Process:**
1. NFT holder submits deployment proposal (location, venue type, expected traffic)
2. Protocol reviews and approves deployment
3. **Rarity tier assigned based on actual location quality:**
   - Population density
   - Venue type and foot traffic
   - Strategic value to network
   - Competition from nearby cameras
4. Tier is permanently locked to that NFT
5. Revenue multiplier activates based on tier

**Rarity Tiers (Concept):**
- Common: Standard locations, base revenue multiplier
- Uncommon: Good locations, enhanced multiplier
- Rare: Premium locations, strong multiplier
- Legendary: Exceptional locations, highest multiplier

### Why This Works

**Gamification Incentives:**
- Operators compete to find the BEST locations (not just deploy anywhere)
- Pre-deployment speculation on which NFTs will achieve high tiers
- Tier reveals create hype events and community engagement
- Quality control maintained by protocol (bad locations don't dilute network)
- Secondary market develops clear pricing tiers

**Consumer Experience:**
- Simple, stable pricing in USD-equivalent
- No exposure to crypto volatility
- Optional benefits from using protocol stablecoin (loyalty, discounts, priority)

**Speculator Experience:**
- Buy/sell Camera NFTs on secondary market
- Clear value thesis: NFT = claim on future revenue stream
- Rarity creates scarcity and price tiers
- Can speculate without touching hardware

**Operator Experience:**
- Buy NFT (speculative investment)
- Deploy physical camera hardware
- Earn revenue share based on actual usage
- Higher tier = higher revenue multiplier = better returns
- Can exit by selling NFT on secondary market

**Protocol Flexibility:**
- Adjust stablecoin pricing for camera access
- Change revenue split ratios
- Modify tier assignment criteria
- Launch new NFT collections with different mechanics
- Add new features and benefits
- Grandfather existing holders when changing terms

## Economic Model

### Revenue Flow

```
Consumer pays stablecoin for camera access
    ↓
Revenue splits:
    → X% to Camera NFT holder (operator revenue share)
    → Y% to Protocol treasury (operations, development)

Protocol treasury uses funds for:
    → Network operations
    → Development and expansion
    → Marketing and growth
    → (Optional) Buybacks or additional incentives
```

### NFT Value Accrual

Camera NFT value = f(expected_revenue, rarity_multiplier, network_growth, time_to_payback)

- Base value: NPV of expected revenue stream
- Rarity premium: Higher tiers command higher multiples
- Network effects: More users → more revenue per camera
- Scarcity: Limited supply per collection creates floor price support

## Supply Management

### Phased Launches

**Genesis Collection:**
- 10,000 Camera NFTs
- Establishes initial network
- Creates founder/early adopter community
- Mint price funds initial operations

**Subsequent Collections:**
- Launch as demand exceeds supply
- Mint price adjusts based on market conditions
- Different metadata/artwork to distinguish from previous collections
- Genesis holders may get priority or bonuses

### Artificial Scarcity Benefits

- Creates FOMO and urgency at launch
- Supports secondary market liquidity
- Prevents network dilution from oversupply
- Allows protocol to capture value through controlled expansion
- Each collection becomes a distinct "vintage" with its own characteristics

## Special Properties & Gamification

### Stablecoin Utility Beyond Payment

- Loyalty points system (spend more → earn benefits)
- Tiered membership (usage-based unlocks)
- Priority access during peak times
- Exclusive features for high-tier users
- Governance rights for major holders
- Referral bonuses and growth incentives

### Dynamic Rarity System

- Annual performance reviews (can upgrade well-performing cameras)
- Relocation mechanics (operators can propose moves to better locations)
- Downgrade risk (poorly performing cameras lose multipliers)
- Creates ongoing engagement and optimization incentives

## Future Considerations

### Potential Extensions

- Fractionalization of high-value NFTs (allow smaller investors to participate)
- Staking mechanics for additional benefits
- Cross-collection benefits (holders of multiple tiers get bonuses)
- International expansion with region-specific collections
- Mobile camera NFTs with different mechanics
- Venue partnerships with special edition NFTs

### Risk Mitigation

- Smart contract upgradability for iteration
- Emergency controls for extreme scenarios
- Transparent tier assignment criteria
- Regular communication of economics changes
- Grandfathering of existing holder rights

## Core Principles

1. **Consumers pay in stable value** - no volatility exposure
2. **Speculation happens on the asset (NFT), not the currency** - clean separation
3. **Rarity is earned through real-world deployment quality** - gamifies network expansion
4. **Supply constraint creates value** - artificial scarcity via collection sizes
5. **Protocol maintains flexibility** - can iterate without breaking existing commitments
6. **Operators have skin in the game** - must maintain quality to keep multipliers
7. **Everything on-chain** - transparent, verifiable, composable

## Why This Is Different

Traditional crypto networks fail because they force utility tokens to be both:
- Stable medium of exchange (for users)
- Speculative growth asset (for investors)

These are opposing forces that create death spirals.

MMOMENT separates these functions:
- Stablecoin = medium of exchange (stable)
- Camera NFT = speculative asset (volatile, based on fundamentals)

This mirrors successful real-world models:
- Real estate: Properties generate rent in USD, property values appreciate
- Taxi medallions: Rides paid in USD, medallions trade based on revenue potential
- AWS: Services paid in credits (pegged to USD), company equity appreciates separately

The innovation is bringing this proven model on-chain with gamification and scarcity mechanics.
